## Overview

This is my attempt on establishing full build CUDA project with modern CMAKE (>3.10). If you are interested on C++ build with moder CMake, I have another [repository](https://github.com/yanuartadityan/cxx-tutorial) for it and it should serve as introduction before this one. 

## Working?

Yes, it is working fine. Even **cuda-gdb** is working fine for debugging. I am using Microsoft Visual Studio Code with these plugins:

* C/C++
* CMake
* CMake Tools

for full IDE experience, including debugging.

## What next?

Soon, I'll combine both C++ and CUDA mixed projects with Modern CMake.

## What OS is this for?

I use Arch, but I think just use CMAKE as your build package managing tools as starter!

## Dependancies?

Modern CMAKE (>3.10), CUDA (I am using CUDA Toolkit 10.0)
