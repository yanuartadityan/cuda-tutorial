# CUDA Build with Modern CMAKE

## Overview

This is my attempt on establishing full build CUDA project with modern CMAKE (>3.10)

## Working?

Yes, it is working

## What else?

Soon, I'll add my build-chain for total workspace with VSCODE as IDE.

## Really?

Yep! Even cuda-gdb is working 

## What OS is this for?

I use Arch, but I think just use CMAKE as your build package managing tools as starter!

## Dependancies?

Modern CMAKE (>3.10), CUDA (I am using CUDA Toolkit 10.0)
